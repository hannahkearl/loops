# Write three functions that take two strings, target and c (which will be a single character). The functions will count how many times c appears in target, returning the result.
# char_count_while: Implements the character counting using a while loop.
# char_count_for: Implements the character counting using a for loop (iterating over the string using indices (using range)).
# char_count_foreach: Implements the character counting using a foreach loop (iterating over each character instead of using range).
